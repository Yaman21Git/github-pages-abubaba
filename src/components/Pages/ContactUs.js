              <h1>Why we are the Best</h1>
              <p>We believe in using ancient methods in order to preserve the product with its utmost nutritional value.</p>
              
              <p>The practice that makes us different, is the elimination of the advanced industrial mechanics in our organic products and by going back to our roots and using the traditional handcrafted methods to achieve the finest quality food.</p>
              <p>Our natural edible Oils are extracted from the traditional Bull-driven Kohlu method as opposed to the Cold-pressed method, which helps in retaining maximum health benefits. And  just like the our Oil, our Ghee and Spices are prepared by our artisans with the traditional Hand-churned Bilona method and Hand-ground method that not only are more nutritious but also reflects the immense love and devotion from our artisans.</p>
